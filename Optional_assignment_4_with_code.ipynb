      "Review: Used to be great now is just a mine of untailored content and agencies who are too young to read  If I wanted to be mailed daily by people who are blanket sending mails to anyone with eyes I would rejoin yahoo  The app constantly signs out yet still works when signed out  Its clearly not secure and doesnt correctly install over old versions The sign in security will ask me if im a bot even if I get the password wrong Meaning I spent 40 seconds looking at 8 pages of street signs only to find out the password was wrong anyway  The fact youre turning it into a facebook style experience proves how out of touch you are Too late to Innovate should be the new moto Emails are not SMS and CVs are not instergram posts In 2016 I tweeted you would make it laggy ugly and a pain to sign into In 2017 im ready to say goodbye for those very reasons  Even the posts section which should be filled with jobs and peoples work is filled with spam from agencies and myothers work that others are ripping off Agencies even use art test work in their next ads There isnt even a way to report that directly meaning plagiarised work never gets pulled Nope nope nope bye bye bye\n",

      "Review: My biggest gripe about this app is the messaging system  its a mess  Give me an inbox that makes any sense    On the main inbox screen I can only see the top three messages and if I want to see more I have to page through each message to get to them  Its actually the envelope icon which you would think would start a new message that opens a list of all the messages in the inbox  And even then I dont seem to be able to see my sent messages or organize my messages in any way     Messages arent threaded so if there are 5 replies back and forth I have five copies of the message in my inbox to page through  Half the time when I click Reply to a message the app opens up a new blank message without even the contact Im replying to in the To field  I have to back out to the message again and hit reply again to get a properly prepopulated message  I use the messaging feature the most of any feature in the app and its frustrating that a company like linkedin hasnt taken some time to make this basic functionality work better  Get your act together\n",

      "Review: Really awful A company page cant even receive messages on here and they restrict livestreaming to only select pages You cant even make a group as a page so essentially everything has to be in your personal name The app is clunky and many posts that you spend time typing out fail to post and disappear Paying for ads on here is like flushing money down the toilet even when you specifically target them based on school or industry\n",
